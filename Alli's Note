How to get root:
Step 1: Hack the Machine
Step 2: You win

Okay, so obviously nobody is saying that hacking is that easy. In fact, unless you really know what you are doing, you aren't going to get very far. Scratch that, unless you are willing to put in the time to learn, you aren't going to get very far.
There are many hard lessons I have learned throughout the last couple years that I have been studying in the cyber security realm. I've studied many books, I've watched countless tutorials, read hundreds of articles, participated in dozens of community events, and yet I more often than not found myself taking a step back, unsure of what I am doing. Admittedly, it can be extremely discouraging and often lead to me taking some long breaks in between learning. However, I have a strong desire to learn, and an even stronger desire to share the experiences and knowledge I am accumulating. One of the most amazing things about the infosec community is everyone's willingness to share information. I want to be a part of that, and to do that, I need to get better about documenting what I am doing and what as a community we are doing. 
So, here we are. A repository for all things that the ITCQ community are doing together. CTF meet ups, write ups, processes, methodology. That is the goal.
